# Ford GoBike
MA415 Final Project

## IMPORTANT NOTES

Due to file size limits by GitHub, the main data file could not be uploaded. However, the data can easily be downloaded from

https://s3.amazonaws.com/fordgobike-data/index.html

Please select the first file ("2017-fordgobike-tripdata.csv"), download, and rename it tripdata_2017.csv. It then needs to be placed in the main directory as well as in FordGoBike/data/tripdata_2017.csv (the Shiny app directory). Otherwise, nothing will run.
